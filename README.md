# LP Checker Tool (Clean Rebuild)

Minimal Next.js 14 (App Router) app with a working `/api/analyze` endpoint and a simple UI.

## Quick Start

```bash
# use Node 22 locally
node -v  # should be v22.x

npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deploy on Vercel

- Make sure the project setting uses **Node 22**.
- Keep **only one** lockfile. This project uses npm (no lockfile committed).
- If you see cache issues, use "Redeploy â†’ Clear build cache".
